# Data Analysis

The following R code was used for the data analysis of Malawsky et al. "Timing of tumor initiation
predicts medulloblastoma heterogeneity, stem cell composition and probability of relapse"

The raw data files used in this analysis can be accessed via NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) at accession XXXX. The workflow presented here begins with the Digital Expression Matrices (DGEs) of UMI counts. These DGEs may be downloaded from GEO as a supplementary file, or may be produced from the provided fastq files following a standard single-cell pre-processing workflow (we recommend the Drop-Seq Tools, found here: https://github.com/broadinstitute/Drop-seq/releases)
